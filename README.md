# InfoRunner

This is an endless runner made in Unity3D.

This prototype was develop by me and InfoJr, a junior company at Sao Paulo State University in March 2016.

Our goal in this project was to become acquainted with some game elements, like UI, sprite animations, mobile inputs and procedurally generated tiles.
